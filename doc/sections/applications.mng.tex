\section{Case Studies}

%This section shows the expressiveness of \name. 
%We show that features of \name
%(dynamically composable traits, intersection types, the merge operator,
%parametric polymorphism and disjoint quantification) enable extensible designs
%that have been presented in mainstream languages. 
%In particular, \name addresses
%limitations of those languages, making the designs significantly
%simpler. 
This section presents two case studies that illustrate the applicatbility of
\name. The first is a larger case study based on the approach to Object Algebras
presented in Section~\ref{sec:objectalgebra}. The case study modulares several
orthogonal features of a subset of JavaScript, used by~\citet{poplcook} in his
undergraduate textbook on programming languages. The case study illustrates that
how various features and operations can be modularly developed and later
composed to assembly a complete language with various operations baked in. The
second is a case study on embedding a higher-order domain-specific language
(simply-typed lambda-calculus with conditional and constants) with a selectable
evaluation order: CBN and CBV. The embedding of typed languages is directly
inspired by Kiselyov's lecture notes~\cite{kiselyov2012typed} on the final
approach to embedding languages. The outcome is an evaluator parameterized over
the evaluation order. This case study shows that features of \name are
sufficient for such a seemingly impossible task, which usually require fancy
types (in particular, GADTs).


\subsection{Modularizing Components in a Small Scripting Language}

Figure~\ref{fig:mini-js} presents the syntax of the expressions, values and
types provided by the features with each line annotated with the corresponding
feature. Starting from a simple arithmetic language, we gradually introduce new
features and combine them with some of the existing features to form various
languages.

The first feature ($\mathit{Arith}$) is a simple language of arithmetic
expressions, containing numerical literals, addition, subtraction, among others.
The second feature ($\mathit{Bool}$) introduces Boolean values, comparison, and
if expressions. The third feature ($\mathit{Var}$) introduces local variables
and variable declarations. And as the last feature ($\mathit{Function}$), we
have top-level functions and functional calls.

For each feature, we also define three operations: evaluator, pretty
printer, and type checker.

\bruno{You should explain the four features.} \jeremy{done}

\bruno{The next 4 subsection {\bf are not what we want to see in a
    case study section}. Repeating the same ideas that were already
  presented in Section~4 is pointless, and that's what you are doing
  here. In a case study you want to measure, evaluate the benefits of
  modularity. For example in terms of SLOC, or how many languages can
  you recover from the components that we have; how many lines are
  required to recover each languages, etc. Please go and have a look
  at Case Study sections of other papers. I suggest ``Scrap your
  Boilerplate as Object Algebras''; and "Meta-theory a la Carte". Also
Weixin's case study on EVF is pretty good.}
\bruno{Also I think you could talk about the subtyping/inheritance
  relations of the languages that you can assemble. Perhaps draw some 
diagrams. }

Figure gives an overview of the reusable components of the implementation, and
the subtyping/inheritance relations of the languages we can assemble. We thus
obtain 4 languages with 12 operations. \jeremy{explain subtyping/inheritance
  relations}

Figure compares the number of source lines of code (SLOC) for \name
implementation with the non-modular implementation in Haskell. The results show
that...

\subsection{The Base Language (Arith)}

We start with a very simple language of arithmetic expressions, as shown on the
left hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:base-lang}. The base language has features
such as literals, addition, subtraction among others. As with examples in
Section~\ref{sec:extensibility}, we use visitors to encode datatypes. The
right hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:base-lang} defines the interfaces of the
operations.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
      \centering
      \lstinputlisting[linerange=135-144]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=BASE_DEF
    \end{subfigure}
    &
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
      \centering
      \lstinputlisting[linerange=116-125]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=INTERFACE
    \end{subfigure}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{The base language (left) and the interfaces of the operations (right)}
  \label{fig:base-lang}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Evaluator}

The evaluation interface (\lstinline{IEval}) contains the \lstinline{eval}
method, which is a function from an evaluation environment (\lstinline{Env}) to
\lstinline{Maybe[Value]}. At this stage, the evaluation environment is not used,
but will be useful when we have variables. The evaluation of the base language
is quite straightforward, so we only show part of the code below:
\lstinputlisting[linerange=170-176]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=BASE_EVALUATOR
To reduce boilerplate code when dealing with \lstinline{Maybe} values, like in
Haskell, we encode the bind operator \lstinline{bind} of the \lstinline{Maybe}
monad.

\subsubsection{Pretty printer and type checker}

Pretty printer and type checker are constructed in a similar manner, as is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:printer} and~\ref{fig:checker}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \lstinputlisting[linerange=197-203]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=PRETTY_BASE
  \caption{An object algebra for pretty printing. }
  \label{fig:printer}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \lstinputlisting[linerange=208-218]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=TYPECHECKER_BASE
  \caption{An object algebra for type checking. }
  \label{fig:checker}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Adding Conditional Expressions (Bool)}

Now we extend the base language with conditional expressions.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=259-264]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=CONDITIONAL
The augmented language now has Boolean literals, comparison features
(\lstinline{eq} and \lstinline{le}) and if expressions.

We omit the code of the operations as they follow the same pattern as we
described in Section~\ref{sec:extensibility}.

% Here is the extended evaluator. Now we need Boolean values.
% \lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=EVALUATOR_CONDITIONAL
% Note that we didn't touch anything from \lstinline{evalArithAlg} but extend it
% to from a new evaluator. Now because the language can produce two kinds of
% values, it is worth noting that \lstinline{fromNum} (or \lstinline{fromBool}) is
% partial, meaning that it can diverge at run-time if the value is not a number
% (or Boolean). This is why we need a type checker to make sure such things cannot
% happen at run-time.

% Same goes for the pretty printer and the type checker.
% \lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=PRETTY_CONDITIONAL
% \lstinputlisting[linerange=-]{}% APPLY:linerange=TYPECHECKER_CONDITIONAL



\subsection{Adding Variable Declarations (Var)}

Next we extend our language again with local variables and variable
declarations. We add two new constructors \lstinline{var} and \lstinline{decl}.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=365-368]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=VARIABLE
For simplicity, we encode variables using strings. \lstinline{decl} takes three
arguments, the first is the variable to be declared, the second is the
expression bound with the variable, and the third is the body within which the
declared variable is in scope. Now the language is interesting enough to express
something like \lstinline{var x = 3; x + 1}.

The evaluator finally makes use of the evaluation environment, which is a
mapping from variables to values.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=386-392]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=EVALUATOR_VARIABLE
For the variable case, we look it up in the environment to find its bound value.
For the declaration case, we evaluate the body expression in the augmented
environment.

We omit the code of pretty printer and type checker for the space reason.

\subsection{Adding Top-level Functions (Function)}

We add, as the final piece, top-level functions to the language. The only
extension is a call expression that takes a function name and an actual
argument expression\footnote{For simplicity, we only allow functions with one
  argument.}.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=420-425]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=TOP_LEVEL

Top-level functions are collected into a function environment, a list of
bindings of function names to function definitions. A program is then a function
environment together with a main expression. We omit the code here, and refer an
interested reader to the supplementary materials.

\end{comment}

\paragraph{Putting all together}

% \bruno{I think the part of the following is the only thing that should
% that could be mentioned here, in a discussion about what does it take
% to assemble a language from components. }

To demonstrate the usage of the final language, we first create a program that
uses all the features the language supports now.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=508-515]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=FINAL_TEST
The concrete syntax of the program is shown in the comment above. We assume a
pre-defined function environment (\lstinline{fenv}) containing the definition of
the \lstinline{add1} function.

Now we can of course apply the operations to the program individually. Instead
of doing this, we go a step further -- we merge those three operations into one,
and apply the combined operation to the program. Here is a function that makes
sure ``well-typed programs cannot go wrong'':
\lstinputlisting[linerange=519-530]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=SUPER_DEF
Note that \lstinline{superAlg} is the combined operation that has the ability to
type check, evaluate, and print a given program. We hope by now the reader can
share our feeling that this is indeed a simple and modular way to cook a
language incrementally.

Finally we apply it to the program we have just created:
\lstinputlisting[linerange=534-535]{../examples/case_study1.txt}% APPLY:linerange=TEST_TEST
Everything works as expected!


\subsection{Parameterizing Expressions by the Evaluation Order}

We now turn to the second case study. In this case study, we embed a
higher-order domain-specific language inside \name. Our object language in this
case study is typed lambda calculus with conditional and constants. This time,
the embedding not only demonstrates the extensibility, as is shown in the first
case study, but also object types, expressed in the meta-language (\name) and
manifestly ensuring well-scoped and well-typed expressions in the object
language. What is more, the evaluator over the object expressions is type
preserving by construction.

\paragraph{Well-typed object expressions} One important issue with such
embedding is how to deal with binders in the object language. In general there
are two options, one can either use deBrujin indices~\cite{}, or higher-order
abstract syntax (HOAS)~\cite{}. Each option has its cons and pros, but for this
particular case study, we find HOAS convenient. HOAS represents object language
abstractions as \name abstractions and object variables as \name variables. By
utilizing the infrastructure of the meta-language, we are free of issues such as
variable capture. Here is the interface of the object language.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=23-28]{../examples/case_study2.txt}% APPLY:linerange=TYPED_LAMBDA
Embedded object expressions of type \lstinline{A} are represented as \name
values of the type \lstinline{Expr[A]}. The \lstinline{bot} constructor, which
represents non-terminating computation, is there for the purpose of illustrating
different evaluation strategies.

A careful reader may notice that the \lstinline{ExprAlg} interface has no
abstractions. This is intentional! Evaluators with different evaluation
strategies only differ in the interpretation for abstractions, as will be shown
later on. For this reason, \lstinline{lam} is moved to a separate interface of
its own.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=15-17]{../examples/case_study2.txt}% APPLY:linerange=ABSTRACTION


\paragraph{Well-typed evaluator}
The benefit of typeful embedding shows up when defining the evaluator.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=32-37]{../examples/case_study2.txt}% APPLY:linerange=TYPED_EVAL
Unlike the evaluator in the first case study, there is no need for a separate
\lstinline{Value} datatype for values, as they are directly modeled by \name
values. Note that the resulting evaluator is \textit{type preserving} by
construction.

\paragraph{Call-by-name, call-by-value}
Our evaluator defined in the first case study inherits the evaluation strategy
from the meta-language. We now show call-by-name and call-by-value evaluators.
The two evaluators are quite alike, sharing most of the code. As said before,
the only difference is the interpretation for \lstinline{lam}.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=67-72]{../examples/case_study2.txt}% APPLY:linerange=CBN_CBV
The call-by-name \lstinline{lam}, when applied, will receive an unevaluated
argument expression, use it as it is. The call-by-value \lstinline{lam}, as in
the call-by-name evaluator, receives an unevaluated argument expression,
evaluates it before passing its result to the abstraction body \lstinline{f}.

Now to make an evaluator parameterized over the evaluation order, we just take a
trait \lstinline{o} with unknown implementation, compose it with other language
features.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=77-77]{../examples/case_study2.txt}% APPLY:linerange=MAKE_EVAL
Here is the call-by-name evaluator at work:
\lstinputlisting[linerange=82-85]{../examples/case_study2.txt}% APPLY:linerange=CBN_TEST
The complete code with several examples can be found in the supplementary
materials.
