\section{Applications}

% Report on various applications encoded with \name. Conduct a larger case study with visitors.

\jeremy{Example of interpreter using visitor pattern from PAPL, illustrating
  ``inheritance is not subtyping''}

This section shows the expressiveness of \name. We show that features of \name
(dynamically composable traits, intersection types, the merge operator,
parametric polymorphism and disjoint quantification) enable extensible designs
that have been presented in mainstream languages. In particular, \name address
limitations of those languages, making the designs significantly simpler. In
what follows, we preset, in a step-by-step way, a modular interpreter that
supports various operations with various features.
