Including some others' work


\subsection{Mainstream Languages with Delegation Mechanism}

\begin{itemize}
\item Clojure Protocols
  % http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-clojure-protocols/
\item Ruby mixin
\item JS mixin
\end{itemize}

They are all dynamically typed.

\subsection{Statically typed Delegation-based Languages}

\begin{itemize}
\item read ``Inheritance is not subtyping'', notice their ``with'' construct can
  only merge records, problematic to encode the extend operator used in JS style
  mixin, it's also a biased operation.

\item ``mixin-based inheritance''

\item ``Dynamically composable collaborations with delegation layers''

\item ``Type-safe delegation for run-time component adaptation''

\item ``A delegation-based object calculus with subtyping''

\item ``Big Bang Designing a Statically-Typed Scripting Language''

\item ``Building a Typed Scripting Language''
  % https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/39502/PALMER-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

\item ``An imperative, first-order calculus with object extension''

\item ``Object-Oriented Multi-Methods in Cecil''

\end{itemize}

Do they have polymorphic type systems? Do they support mutable self reference?

\subsection{Class-based Languages with More Advanced Form of Inheritance}

\begin{itemize}
\item Eiffel

\item ``Nominal and Structural Subtyping in Component-Based Programming''
\item ``Object-Oriented Composition Untangled''
