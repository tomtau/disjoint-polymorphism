\section{A Critique of Mainstream Class-Based OOP}

This section discusses several points about mainstream OOP languages
that work against modularity. 

\subsection{No Contravariant Subtyping on Arguments}

Simple example that illustrates this. Need an example with contravariant arguments

\subsection{No Separation Between Inheritance and Subtyping}

Example: visitors. 

\subsection{No Dynamic Inheritance}

Example: find good example? Design patterns? Dynamic Proxies?

\subsection{No Multiple Inheritance of Same Class}

Example: composing Object Algebras (can relate to visitors).
