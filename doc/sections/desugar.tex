\section{Desugaring}
\label{sec:desugar}


The section provides the procedures of desugaring traits to \bname. The idea
behind trait translation is inspired by the functional mixin
semantics~\cite{cook1989denotational} using open reucursion, which is proposed
by Cook in an untyped setting. However, our translation is done in the context
of a statically-typed programming language, which is exactly why conflicts can
be \textit{statically} detected in traits.
